# Pre-work - TipCalculator

TipCalculator is a tip calculator application for iOS.
*Due to issues related to me having to switch computers too often (school computers) I had to upload the updated version of my code which included the optionals as its own folder with the description saying those are the optionals. The other 2 folders are now unnecessary.
